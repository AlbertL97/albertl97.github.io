# ðŸ™‹ About Me

Hi! I'm a PhD student and researcher passionate about how immersive technologies and AI can support cognition and well-being. I'm currently exploring:

- Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
- Mental health tech
- Human-computer interaction in VR

This site is my public research garden â€” a mix of formal and informal ideas.
